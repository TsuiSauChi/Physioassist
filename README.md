# Physioassist

Currently, there are many patients who need to use the rehabilitation centre for physiotherapy. However, Singapore has only one rehabilitation centre at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. If this problem persists, it would slow down the efficiency of physiotherapy for patients (especially the seniors).

We have created a platform for the physiologist to monitor patients when discharged from the hospital. Normally, patients are expected to continue the exercise routine after being discharged, however, due to the lack of communication between the physiologist and the patients, patients may be confused on how to properly continue the exercise routine.
Hence, creating a platform for the physiologist to update exercise tutorial to patients to view would help patients go through a better recovery process. 

## Technology 
1. Computer Vision: For physiologist to verify whether the patient to doing the exercise correctly 
2. Artificial intelligence: As a gather data from the patients, we are able to predict the most proper exercise routine for the patients
